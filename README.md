Better UX on the map icons, or a legends tab

People has been asking if it's possible to add droppable divination cards to the maps.

People want to filter by 3 dots too (unique shields)

We NEED a help tab.

People still want to see how to get the maps from vendor recipes (think the old arrows). I suggest that we put the vendor recipe in the hovers.

Add the 3 new maps added in 2.0.1
